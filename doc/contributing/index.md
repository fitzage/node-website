The Node.js community is large and inclusive, and excited to enable as many users to contribute in whatever what they can. If what you're looking to do is report an issue, or learn how to contribute to our projects, this is the right place to learn how.

Node.js as a software project aims to provide a small and maintainable interface to enable its consumers to use it to the fullest. Similarly the team of engineers that control the source repository for Node.js is small.

Node.js documentation is a living network that compounds with new infomation for each release. We rely on the community to help identify areas that need clarification, provide valuable resources on using the language, and localizing text in multiple languages.
